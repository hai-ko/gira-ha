# POLLING STATE LOGGING ENHANCEMENT

## ðŸ“‹ CHANGES MADE

Enhanced the Gira X1 integration to log polled state changes for better visibility into device state updates.

## ðŸ”§ NEW LOGGING FEATURES

### **State Change Detection**
```log
ðŸ”„ POLLED STATE CHANGE: a02u: '0' â†’ '1'
ðŸ”„ POLLED STATE CHANGE: a03c: '1' â†’ '0'
ðŸ“Š Total polled state changes: 2
```

### **No Changes Detected**
```log
No state changes detected in polling cycle
```

### **Initial Polling Cycle**
```log
ðŸ“Š Initial polling cycle - received 45 datapoint values
Initial value: a02u = '0'
Initial value: a03c = '1'
Initial value: a060 = '0.392157'
...
```

### **Polling Failure Handling**
```log
Failed to poll for values: Connection timeout
Using cached values due to polling failure (45 values)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ BENEFITS

1. **Real-time Visibility**: See exactly when device states change
2. **Change Tracking**: Monitor which datapoints are changing and their values
3. **Debugging Aid**: Easily identify if polling is working and detecting changes
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track polling success/failure rates
5. **Initial State Visibility**: See what values are discovered on startup

## ðŸ“Š LOG LEVELS

- **INFO**: State changes and summary information
- **DEBUG**: Detailed polling information and initial values
- **WARNING**: Polling failures and error conditions

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT

The enhanced logging is now active. When you run the integration, you'll see:

1. **Every 5 seconds**: Polling cycle initiation
2. **When changes occur**: Detailed state change logs with old â†’ new values
3. **Summary information**: Total number of changes detected per cycle
4. **Error handling**: Clear logging when polling fails

This provides excellent visibility into the pure polling operation and helps with debugging and monitoring device state changes.

# Gira X1 Integration - Comprehensive Logging Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Added

### 1. Enhanced Coordinator Logging
- **Connection Testing**: Detailed logging of connection attempts with host/port info
- **Initial Data Fetch**: Comprehensive logging of UI config retrieval and analysis
- **Raw Function Data**: Complete structure logging of first 5 functions from device
- **Function Type Analysis**: Distribution analysis of all function and channel types found
- **Update Cycle Tracking**: Detailed logging of UI config changes and refresh cycles

### 2. Platform Setup Logging
- **Switch Platform**: Complete entity discovery process logging with mapping analysis
- **Light Platform**: Comprehensive setup logging including dimmer switch detection
- **Unmapped Type Detection**: Automatic identification of function/channel types not in const.py
- **Entity Creation Tracking**: Detailed logging of each entity created or skipped

### 3. Debug Tools
- **Standalone Debug Script** (`debug_entity_discovery.py`): Independent tool to analyze device data
- **Comprehensive Documentation** (`DEBUG_LOGGING_SUMMARY.md`): Complete guide for troubleshooting

## üîç Key Logging Features

### Real-time Mapping Analysis
The integration now automatically detects and reports:
- All function types found in your device
- All channel types found in your device  
- Types that are not mapped in const.py
- Exact match/no-match decisions for each function

### Sample Log Output You'll See
```
INFO: Successfully connected to Gira X1
INFO: Found 25 functions and 150 values
INFO: Function types found: {'de.gira.schema.functions.Switch': 12, 'de.gira.schema.functions.KNX.Light': 8, ...}
INFO: === RAW UI CONFIG DEBUG ===
INFO: Function 1 complete structure: {'uid': 'xxx', 'displayName': 'Living Room Light', ...}
INFO: ALL function types found in device data: ['de.gira.schema.functions.Switch', ...]
WARNING: UNMAPPED function types found: ['de.gira.schema.functions.CustomType']
INFO: Adding switch entity: Living Room Switch (uid123) - de.gira.schema.functions.Switch
INFO: Switch platform setup complete: 5 switch entities created
```

## üöÄ Next Steps for You

### 1. Update Debug Script Configuration
Edit `debug_entity_discovery.py` and update these lines with your actual values:
```python
host = "192.168.1.100"  # Your Gira X1 IP address
port = 443              # Usually 443 for HTTPS
username = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
```

### 2. Test the Debug Script
```bash
cd /Users/heikoburkhardt/repos/gira-x1-ha
python debug_entity_discovery.py
```

This will show you exactly what function types your device reports and whether they match the current mappings.

### 3. Restart Home Assistant
With the enhanced logging, restart Home Assistant and check the logs for:
- Connection success
- Function types found
- Entity creation counts
- Any unmapped types

### 4. Check Home Assistant Logs
Look for log entries from `custom_components.gira_x1` to see the detailed analysis.

### 5. Update Mappings If Needed
If unmapped function types are found, add them to `custom_components/gira_x1/const.py`:

```python
GIRA_FUNCTION_TYPES = {
    # Add any unmapped types found in logs
    "de.gira.schema.functions.YourUnmappedType": DEVICE_TYPE_SWITCH,
    # ... existing mappings ...
}
```

## üéØ Expected Outcomes

With this comprehensive logging, you should be able to:

1. **Verify Connection**: Confirm the integration connects successfully to your Gira X1
2. **See Raw Data**: View the exact function structures your device reports
3. **Identify Mapping Issues**: Discover any function types not covered by current mappings
4. **Track Entity Creation**: See exactly which entities are created and why others aren't
5. **Fix Missing Mappings**: Add any missing function type mappings to const.py

## üîß If No Entities Are Still Created

The logs will now tell you exactly why:

- **No functions found**: UI config fetch issue
- **Functions found but unmapped**: Missing mappings in const.py  
- **Functions mapped but no entities**: Platform setup issue
- **Entities created but not visible**: Home Assistant entity registration issue

## üìù Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `custom_components/gira_x1/__init__.py` - Enhanced coordinator logging
- ‚úÖ `custom_components/gira_x1/switch.py` - Comprehensive platform logging  
- ‚úÖ `custom_components/gira_x1/light.py` - Detailed entity discovery logging
- ‚úÖ `debug_entity_discovery.py` - Standalone debug tool created
- ‚úÖ `DEBUG_LOGGING_SUMMARY.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

The integration now has comprehensive logging that will definitively identify why no entities are being created. Run the debug script first to see what your device reports, then restart Home Assistant to see the detailed logs in action!

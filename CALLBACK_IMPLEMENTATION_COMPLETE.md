# Gira X1 Callback Implementation - Complete

## üéâ Implementation Summary

The Gira X1 Home Assistant integration has been successfully upgraded from a 30-second polling system to a real-time callback-based system. This transformation provides instant updates when device values change, significantly improving responsiveness and reducing unnecessary network traffic.

## üîß Technical Changes Made

### 1. Constants Configuration (`const.py`)
- Added `API_CALLBACKS_PATH = "/callbacks"` for API endpoint
- Added `CALLBACK_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS = 300` (5-minute fallback polling)
- Added webhook paths:
  - `WEBHOOK_VALUE_CALLBACK_PATH = "/api/gira_x1/callback/value"`
  - `WEBHOOK_SERVICE_CALLBACK_PATH = "/api/gira_x1/callback/service"`
- Added configuration options:
  - `CONF_CALLBACK_URL_OVERRIDE` for custom callback URLs
  - `CONF_CALLBACK_TOKEN` for callback authentication

### 2. API Client Enhancement (`api.py`)
- Added `register_callbacks()` method with URL validation and test callback support
- Added `unregister_callbacks()` method for proper cleanup
- Integrated callback registration with authentication flow
- Added error handling and logging for callback operations

### 3. Webhook System (`webhook.py`)
- Created `GiraX1ValueCallbackView` for real-time value updates
- Created `GiraX1ServiceCallbackView` for device events (restart, config changes)
- Implemented token validation for security
- Added real-time coordinator data updates via `async_set_updated_data()`
- Included comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Coordinator Updates (`__init__.py`)
- Added callback setup and cleanup methods
- Implemented hybrid mode: callbacks for real-time + reduced polling as fallback
- Added external URL detection for webhook registration
- Enhanced update logic to preserve values in callback mode
- Added automatic callback re-registration after device restarts

### 5. Integration Metadata (`manifest.json`)
- Changed `iot_class` from "local_polling" to "local_push"
- Added "http" dependency for webhook support

## üöÄ Architecture Transformation

### Before (Polling System)
```
Home Assistant ‚Üí (every 30 seconds) ‚Üí Gira X1
                                    ‚Üê Poll for changes
```

### After (Callback System)
```
Home Assistant ‚Üê (instant updates) ‚Üê Gira X1
               ‚Üí (webhook registration) ‚Üí
               ‚Üê (5-minute health check) ‚Üê
```

## üìã Key Features

### Real-Time Updates
- Instant notifications when Gira X1 device values change
- No more 30-second delays for state updates
- Efficient bandwidth usage

### Fallback Reliability
- Continues polling every 5 minutes as backup
- Automatic recovery if callbacks fail
- Graceful degradation to polling mode

### Service Event Handling
- Responds to Gira X1 device restarts
- Handles configuration changes
- Automatic callback re-registration

### Security
- Token-based webhook authentication
- Validation of all incoming callback requests
- Secure HTTPS communication

## üîç Validation Results

All implementation tests passed successfully:
- ‚úÖ Callback constants properly defined
- ‚úÖ API methods for callback registration/unregistration
- ‚úÖ Webhook handlers with proper structure and token validation
- ‚úÖ Manifest updated for push-based integration
- ‚úÖ Coordinator setup for callback management

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Installation
1. Copy the updated integration files to your Home Assistant custom_components folder
2. Restart Home Assistant

### 2. Configuration
The integration will automatically use callbacks with existing configurations. Optional parameters:
```yaml
# configuration.yaml (optional overrides)
gira_x1:
  callback_url_override: "https://your-external-domain.com"  # If HA not directly accessible
  callback_token: "custom-security-token"  # Custom authentication token
```

### 3. Verification
Monitor Home Assistant logs for callback activity:
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
grep "Successfully registered callbacks" home-assistant.log
grep "Received value callback" home-assistant.log
grep "Callback registration" home-assistant.log
```

### 4. Testing Real-Time Updates
1. Change a device value through the Gira interface
2. Observe immediate update in Home Assistant (no 30-second delay)
3. Check Developer Tools ‚Üí Events for `gira_x1_callback_received` events

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Callback Registration Issues
- Ensure Home Assistant is accessible from the Gira X1 device
- Check firewall settings allow incoming webhooks
- Verify network connectivity between devices

### Fallback to Polling
- If callbacks fail, integration automatically falls back to 5-minute polling
- Check logs for error messages about callback registration
- Ensure Gira X1 firmware supports callback API (v2.x required)

### Network Configuration
- For external access, configure `callback_url_override` with your public URL
- Ensure reverse proxy (if used) forwards webhook requests correctly
- Check SSL certificate validity for HTTPS webhooks

## üìä Performance Impact

### Benefits
- ‚ö° Instant updates instead of 30-second delays
- üìâ Reduced network traffic (no constant polling)
- üîã Lower CPU usage (event-driven vs. timer-based)
- üéØ Better user experience with immediate feedback

### Resource Usage
- üìà Minimal increase in webhook processing
- üìâ Significant reduction in periodic API calls
- ‚öñÔ∏è Overall net performance improvement

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deploy and Test**: Install the updated integration and test with your Gira X1 device
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for successful callback registration and real-time updates
3. **Verify Performance**: Confirm instant state changes when devices are controlled

### Future Enhancements
1. **Callback Analytics**: Add metrics for callback success rates and latency
2. **Advanced Configuration**: Web UI for callback settings and troubleshooting
3. **Batch Updates**: Optimize handling of multiple simultaneous value changes
4. **Webhook Security**: Additional security layers for webhook endpoints

## üìù Implementation Notes
